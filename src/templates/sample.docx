HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE
You have the control of using this guide to learn about whatever aspect of your Nutrition & Fitness genome that you wish. You can read the entire guide or skip to the sections that you are most interested in to gain valuable insights about your Nutrition & Fitness traits. Each section will display the relevant data in an easy to understand format with your result, an interpretation, summary and recommendation when indicated.
The conditions or traits in this report are often multigenic or multifactorial, so your predisposition likelihood or relative risk (relative to the average risk in the population) will be given to you and you may be classiﬁed as (low risk, intermediate risk, or high risk) which will be indicated by a "risk meter" as shown below.


In addition, for these multigenic or multifactorial diseases or traits, the scientiﬁc strength of each polymorphism or variant analyzed is indicated using a 5 star rating system  and is factored in to the genetic risk score. The scientiﬁc strength is based on 4 factors of evidence that contribute to the strength. 1. The size of the research study (i.e. how many people enrolled in the study) 2. the power of the association (power with genome wide signiﬁcance of 5 x 10-8 and less) 3. the eﬀect size (i e size of the odds ratio) 4. and whether the results were replicated.

HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE
For traits that are aﬀected by metabolism possible results may include poor metabolizer, intermediate metabolizer, normal metabolizer, rapid metabolizer, or ultra-rapid metabolizer as shown below. When possible, an interpretation and recommendations given, as well as, dosage / side eﬀect warning.
ULTRARAPID METABOLIZER RAPID METABOLIZER NORMAL METABOLIZER
INTERMEDIATE METABOLIZER
POOR METABOLIZER
ULTRARAPID METABOLIZER RAPID METABOLIZER NORMAL METABOLIZER
INTERMEDIATE METABOLIZER
POOR METABOLIZER

DISCLAIMER
This report can be used by the individual being tested to gain insights about his or her DNA makeup and how it is related to his or her wellness traits (not considered clinical in nature). It is highly recommended to review these results with a qualiﬁed health care professional, nutritionist and/or ﬁtness trainer. This test was developed, and its performance characteristics determined by the testing laboratory. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any other regulatory agency. The laboratory and its partners are regulated under CLIA as qualiﬁed to perform high-complexity testing. Although actionable insights may be gained from this test/report, this test/report is to be regarded as investigational or for research only, and it does not take the place of recommendations set by your healthcare provider, nutritionist or ﬁtness trainer.
Although this test is a comprehensive test that genotypes and analyzes many parts of your genome (approximately 730,000 data points using microarray technology that tests coding and intergenic or non- coding regions of your genome) this test does have limitations. Also, please keep in mind that the analysis and interpretation were performed at the best of our abilities using the current up-to-date scientiﬁc knowledge, but as the scientiﬁc knowledge changes there may be changes to your report/results and the way it should be interpreted. We will make every eﬀort to notify you of such changes in the future as science catches up, but there are no guarantees and you may use this report/guide today at your own risk. We will not be held liable for any errors presented in this report (due to limitations of the technology or for any other reason) or actions you or your healthcare provider, nutritionist or ﬁtness trainer may decide to take based on the results of this report/guide. For more information about the limitations of this test see the "Limitations section" at the end of this report/guide.
