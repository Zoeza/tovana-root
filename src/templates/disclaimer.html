            <h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>
            <p>This report can be used by the individual being tested to gain insights about his or her DNA makeup and how it is related to his or her wellness traits (not considered clinical in nature). It is highly recommended to review these results with a qualified health care professional, nutritionist and/or fitness trainer. This test was developed, and its performance characteristics determined by the testing laboratory. It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any other regulatory agency. The laboratory and its partners are regulated under CLIA as qualified to perform high-complexity testing. Although actionable insights may be gained from this test/report, this test/report is to be regarded as investigational or for research only, and it does not take the place of recommendations set by your healthcare provider, nutritionist or fitness trainer. </p>
            <p>Although this test is a comprehensive test that genotypes and analyzes many parts of your genome (approximately 730,000 data points using microarray technology that tests coding and  intergenic or non-coding regions of your genome) this test does have limitations. Also, please keep in mind that the analysis and interpretation were performed at the best of our abilities using the current up-to-date scientific knowledge, but as the scientific knowledge changes there may be changes to your report/results and the way it should be interpreted. We will make every effort to notify you of such changes in the future as science catches up, but there are no guarantees and you may use this report/guide today at your own risk. We will not be held liable for any errors presented in this report (due to limitations of the technology or for any other reason) or actions you or your healthcare provider, nutritionist or fitness trainer may decide to take based on the results of this report/guide. For more information about the limitations of this test see the "Limitations section" at the end of this report/guide.</p>
