                    "Hair loss is a physical trait that can begin to occur at any age in adult males and the prevalence is known to increase with age. There is a known strong genetic component to hair loss that can predispose a person to more severe and earlier hair loss than the average population risk. Hair loss is sometimes referred to as male pattern baldness or in medical terms androgenetic alopecia, which is considered the most common form of hair loss in men. Studies have shown that when male pattern baldness occurs at an early age or prematurely there is an increased risk for cardiometabolic disease, (e.g. coronary artery disease, elevated cholesterol levels,  hypertension, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome) and prostate cancer."

Hair follicles that are sensitive to DHT begin to miniaturize, shortening the lifespan of each hair follicle affected. Over time, after continuous exposure to DHT, these affected follicles stop producing hair.</p>",
                    "<p>Variants (DNA changes) or SNPs in the <i>AR</i> gene coding for the androgen receptor protein located on the X chromosome, has been shown to be highly indicative of the risk of developing male pattern baldness. The risk allele in the <b>rs6152 SNP is G</b>, but other polymorphisms contribute significantly to male pattern baldness. <b>Another risk allele is T, in the rs1385699 SNP</b> of the <b><i>EDA2R</i> gene</b> produces a protein that can cause activation of the androgen receptor protein <i>AR</i> gene that increases the risk for hair loss. Both these SNPs are located on the X chromosome, which means it mostly affects males, however, baldness may also occur in females that are homozygous for the <b>rs6152 GG</b> genotype and are harboring additional SNPs risk alleles required for baldness.</p>"

They have a high affinity for nicotine and serve critical roles in nicotine self-administration and its positive reinforcement. Functional studies have shown that reduced <em>CHRNA4</em> expression in brain significantly attenuated sensitivity to nicotine agonist. This is consistent with the finding that rs2273500-C decreases <em>CHRNA4</em> expression and, by lowering sensitivity to nicotine&rsquo;s effects, confers risk for nicotine dependence.&nbsp; Further supporting the relevance of <em>CHRNA4</em>, highly effective treatments for smoking cessation, varenicline and cytisine are partial agonists of &alpha;4&beta;2 receptors.</p>"

                    "<p>The <strong>rs1051730</strong> SNP in the <strong><em>CHRNA3</em></strong> <strong>gene</strong> showed strong association with CPD in 3 different studies. I one of the studies each copy of the <strong>A allele of rs1051730</strong> corresponded to an increase in smoking quantity of 1 CPD and accounted for 0.5% of the variance in CPD. In multiple studies the <strong>A allele</strong> of the <strong>rs2036527</strong> SNP located in the distal enhancer region of the <strong><em>CHRNA5</em></strong> <strong>gene</strong> was associated with increased CPD. Biologically, it is plausible that increased expression of the <em>CHRNA5</em> gene due to the rs2036527 SNP, could be associated with smoking quantity as a consequence of neuro-adaptations resulting from complex interactions between genes and environment that alter positive and negative reinforcement. This is supported by an animal study in KO (knock-out) mice which showed that re-expressing this gene in the medial habenula, which extends projections to a brain region shown to mediate nicotine withdrawal, abolished the inhibitory effects of nicotine while maintaining the reinforcing effects of nicotine. Further support was achieved with a functional magnetic resonance study of smokers, showing that genetic variation in <em>CHRNA5</em> appeared to also affect reactivity to smoking cues in the insula, hippocampus and dorsal striatum, regions implicated in addictive behavior and memory.</p>",
                    "<p>A genome-wide significant association of increased CPD was also found with the <strong>C allele</strong> of the <strong>rs2273500</strong> SNP, a splice site acceptor variant with important regulatory effects for the <strong><em>CHRNA4</em></strong> <strong>gene</strong>, resulted in decreased <strong><em>CHRNA4</em></strong> <strong>gene</strong> expression in physiologically normal human brains. The <strong>alpha-4 nicotinic receptor subunit (</strong><strong><em>CHRNA4</em></strong><strong>) gene</strong> has strong biological plausibility for influencing nicotine dependence and consequently its adverse health effects. The subunits encoded by <em>CHRNA4</em> and <em>CHRNB2</em> comprise &alpha;4&beta;2 receptors, the most abundantly expressed nicotine acetylcholine receptors in the brain. They have a high affinity for nicotine and serve critical roles in nicotine self-administration and its positive reinforcement. Functional studies have shown that reduced <em>CHRNA4</em> expression in brain significantly attenuated sensitivity to nicotine agonist. This is consistent with the finding that rs2273500-C decreases <em>CHRNA4</em> expression and, by lowering sensitivity to nicotine&rsquo;s effects, confers risk for increased CPD and nicotine dependence. &nbsp;Further supporting the relevance of <em>CHRNA4</em>, highly effective treatments for smoking cessation, varenicline and cytisine are partial agonists of &alpha;4&beta;2 receptors.</p>",

There was a <strong>reduction of 0.76 drinks/week per copy of the rs671-A allele</strong> in these subjects. <strong>rs671</strong> impairs the processing of ALDH2 and causes deficiency in ALDH2 activity, in turn causing an accumulation in the body of acetaldehyde, which is toxic and leads to undesirable reactions, including nausea. Therefore, individuals who carry at least one copy of rs671-A allele drink typically less and are protected against heavy alcohol use and alcohol use disorders. In the same study, the <strong>rs1229984</strong> SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) in the <strong><em>ADH1B</em></strong> <strong>gene</strong> with carriers of the T allele being less likely to report consuming alcohol with <strong>a reduction of 1.26 drinks per week per copy of the T allele</strong> being reported. In vivo (i.e. within the body), rs1229984-T allele carriers eliminate ethanol more quickly after heavy drinking and have lower blood alcohol concentrations in comparison to homozygous wild-type individuals. Thus, individuals who carry at least one copy of rs1229984-T allele are less exposed to circulating ethanol and might be less likely to develop a tolerance and dependence to alcohol.</p>",

In an animal study, it was shown that brain-specific &beta;-Klotho KO (knock out) mice had an increased alcohol preference and that FGF21 inhibits alcohol drinking by acting on the brain.

This polymorphism is a strong expression quantitative trait locus for the cholinergic receptor nicotinic &alpha;2 subunit (CHRNA2) protein. Analyses of the genetically regulated gene expression identified a significant association of <em>CHRNA2</em> gene expression with CUD in the brain tissue, especially the cerebellum, with the risk allele (rs56372821-G) being associated with decreased expression of the gene. The cerebellum may play a role in addiction with regard to reward and inhibitory control, and reward-anticipating responses. The cerebellum has a high density of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), which mediates the effect of &Delta;-9-tetrahydrohydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive compound in cannabis. Cerebellum has also been found to be affected by cannabis use in neuroanatomical studies. The observed association of CHRNA2 under-expression with CUD, also implies that the &alpha;2 subunit can be a potential drug target in the treatment of CUD, by using an agonist selective for &alpha;2 subunit-containing nAChRs. This study also suggested that for individuals with risk alleles, the age at first diagnosis of CUD is earlier than for individuals that do not carry a risk allele. &nbsp;</p>",

The hippocampus has been implicated in addiction, including volumetric differences that have been observed in chronic cannabis users.

Epigenetically mediated changes in gene expression, which have been reported to occur with opioid use is one plausible mechanism for the functional association of this intronic SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism). The rs10799590 SNP is located within an enhancer that is specific to fetal brain and is predicted to be within the binding site of transcription factor (TF) TAL1 (which plays important roles in middle brain GABAergic neuron differentiation). The <strong>G risk-allele</strong> has significantly higher binding potential than the A allele. Furthermore, G allele homozygotes (with the <strong>GG genotype</strong>) had blunted right amygdala habituation to threat-related facial expressions (a reliable intermediate phenotype linked to psychopathology) relative to A allele carriers. Genetic analyses of mouse strain data further support the involvement of <em>CNIH3</em>, in murine opioid physical dependence. Collectively, these study findings support the <em>CNIH3</em> gene involvement in the pathophysiology of opioid dependence complementing prior studies implicating the AMPA glutamate system in the brain which plays an important role in context-dependent sensitization to morphine.</p>",

Pathway analysis in this study also implicated other genes involved in calcium signaling and long-term potentiation. Potassium-calcium signaling may couple neuronal signaling to vasodilation in the brain and opioids can regulate calcium conductance via increasing potassium conductance in &mu;-opioid receptors.</p>",
                    "<p>Serving as the primary site for the analgesic action of most clinical opioids such as &nbsp;morphine, methadone and heroin, the <strong><em>OPRM1</em> &mu;-opioid receptor</strong> <strong>gene</strong> has been considered as the predominant genetic candidate responsible for vulnerability to opioid dependence, as well as dependence on other substances of abuse, such as alcohol and nicotine. Rapid activation of the &mu;-opioid receptor by heroin and/or its analogs results in an euphoric effect that may have confer reinforcing or rewarding effects of the drug, and thus contribute to the development of drug addiction. Allelic variants at the <em>OPRM1</em> locus have been identified in both mouse and human. One such allele is the <strong>G allele</strong> of the <strong>rs9479757 </strong>polymorphism with one study showing that carriers of this allele had a higher level of addiction to heroin. In another study, this same intronic SNP (rs9479757) was again associated with severity of heroin addiction, with the AG genotype associated with mild addiction and the GG genotype associated with severe addiction. In vitro studies (i.e. experiments done outside the human body) have identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H (hnRNPH) as the major binding partner for the G-containing SNP site, which serves as a modifier of <em>OPRM1</em> alternative splicing and expression, and suggests a functional link between this SNP and the severity of heroin addiction. Finally, in another relatively large study the <strong>C allele</strong> of the <strong>rs3778150</strong> polymorphism was associated with both reduced <em>OPRM1</em> expression and increased risk of heroin addiction. The down-regulation of <em>OPRM1</em> may play a role in increasing risk of heroin addiction by disrupting the opioid system of a key compensatory response to heroin.</p>",
                    "<p>More specifically, heroin exposure results in reduced &mu;-receptor function, and in response, the opioid system upregulates <em>OPRM1</em> expression to make more &mu;-receptors available. It is plausible that genetic polymorphisms, such as the <strong>rs3778150</strong> polymorphism, attenuating <em>OPRM1</em> expression could hinder this compensatory mechanism, leading to a greater quantity of heroin being needed to trigger a physiological effect and thus increasing risk of becoming addicted to and dependent on heroin. This study also showed that the functional <strong>A allele </strong>of the rs1799971 polymorphism was associated with heroin addiction only in the presence of rs3778150-C allele, establishing the rs3778150-C/ rs1799971-A as a heroin addiction risk haplotype.</p>"

                    "Muscle strength and power have an important influence on functional abilities and exercise or sports performance. Both environmental stimuli (i.e. nutrition, training) are important contributing factors to muscle strength and power, and genetic factors have also been shown to have an important impact on these traits. Except for improving athletic performance, building and maintaining muscle strength and power has multiple health benefits including decreasing the risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis (bone disease) and cardiovascular disease (such as coronary artery disease or heart attack)."

                    "<p>Research has shown that the <b>T allele</b> at the <b>rs1815739 polymorphism</b> in the <b><i>ACTN3</i> gene</b> can lead to decreased levels or deficiency of the &alpha;-actinin-3 protein (a protein important in maintaining the myofibrillar array within the muscle fibers) and can impair muscle strength/power and performance. Individuals with the <b>TT genotype</b> at this position were shown to have altered type-2 muscle fibers (fast twitch muscle fibers) morphology (appearance) and both decreased power and strength, as well as sprinting ability. This genotype is not typically found in high performance power/strength athletes, who were found to possess a <b>CC genotype</b> instead. In addition, research has shown that when an individual has an <b>rs1815739 CC genotype</b> in the <b><i>ACTN3</i> gene</b> and also has the <b>rs11549465 CC genotype</b> in the <b><i>HIF1A</i> gene</b> (that codes for a transcription factor that regulates the activity of other genes in response to hypoxia or decreased oxygen, so that the body can still produce energy) are more likely to excel in power/strength related sports such as sprinting.   </p>",
                    "<p>Individuals homozygous for the <b>rs2854464 A allele (i.e. AA genotype)</b> in the <b><i>ACVR1B</i> gene</b> also showed increased strength (~2% in dynamic knee extensor strength) compared to the GG or AG genotypes.  </p>",
                    "<p>Other studies have shown that the <b>C allele at rs699</b> in the <b><i>AGT</i> gene</b> results in more angiotensin and angiotensin II levels, a skeletal muscle growth factor favoring strength- and power-related performance. For this reason, power and strength athletes (e.g. throwers, jumpers, sprinters) are more likely to be carriers of the <b>CC genotype</b> as opposed to the TT or TC genotype.   </p>",
                    "<p>The <b><i>AMPD1</i> gene</b>, is important in skeletal muscle energy metabolism during exercise, and the <b>T allele</b> at the <b>rs17602729 polymorphism</b> results in deficiency of the AMPD protein, causing impaired AMP metabolism that produces muscle fatigue, weakness and cramping. It has been shown that soccer players, who are considered power/strength sprinters possess the <b>C allele</b> and <b>CT genotype</b> at significantly higher frequency, than compared to endurance runners. Another study showed that the <b>T allele</b> was underrepresented (i.e. low frequency) in power-oriented athletes compared to controls.</p>",
                    "<p>The <b>G allele rs1799983 polymorphism</b> in the <b><i>NOS3</i> gene</b> has also been shown at greater frequency in power-athletes compared to controls or endurance athletes. The greater production of NO (nitric oxide) in individuals with the <b>GG</b> or <b>GT genotype</b>, allows for increased blood supply, hypertrophy of the muscles, as well as greater skeletal muscle glucose uptake, and may serve as a scientific explanation for this association.  </p>",
                    "<p>Finally, with respect to the <b><i>UCP2</i> gene rs660339 polymorphism</b>, there is a greater <b>C allele</b> frequency in elite power athletes compared with controls, but this was only a small study and should be considered preliminary. </p>",
                    "<p>Although genetic polymorphisms contribute to an individual's ability to excel in power/strength vs. endurance performance sports other factors such as gene-gene interactions, environmental, and epigenetic factors are also important contributors. </p>"

                    "Human obesity defined as a BMI or body mass index of 30 kg/m2 is caused by a complex interplay of genes and environment. The prevalence of obesity and its co-morbidities has increased during the last few decades and excess body weight is now a major public health problem. Although the reason for the increase in obesity prevalence has been largely attributed to lifestyle or environmental factors (such as poor diet or lack of physical activity), genetic factors also play an important role in the susceptibility to obesity. ",
                    "Maintaining a physically active lifestyle is important for all individuals in preventing weight gain and has other health benefits. Studies have shown that in individuals with certain genetic risk factors for obesity, physical activity can significantly mitigate the genetic risk of increased BMI that could lead to obesity. "

The <i>FTO</i> gene is highly expressed in the hypothalamus, which is known to regulate energy homeostasis. Evidence has shown that <i>FTO</i> risk variants are associated with increased energy intake and several studies have shown that physical activity (resulting in energy expenditure) can modify the genetic effects of the <i>FTO</i> gene variants that give rise to increased risk of obesity.</p>",

In several studies, including two large meta-analysis studies each involving over 200,000 individuals of various ancestries, the effect of the <i>FTO</i> gene risk allele and genotype is attenuated by as much as 27%-30% in physically active individuals compared to inactive individuals. As such, these individuals are considered good responders to physical activity, and the importance of moderate to increased intensity physical activity should be stressed in these individuals to help prevent the risk of obesity and its associated risks.</p>"

This gene comprises approximately 13% of all CYP proteins and contributes to the metabolism of a number of clinically important drugs, procarcinogens, and endogenous substrates. Drug exposure and clinical effects may either be reduced for an active drug converted to inactive metabolite or increased for a prodrug converted to active metabolite. Inducers of the CYP1A2 enzyme activity include tobacco smoke, regular consumption of cruciferous vegetables or grilled meats, and certain drugs (such as omperazole and carbamazepine). Inhibitors of the CYP1A2 enzyme activity include CYP1A2 drugs such as fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin and oral contraceptives.",

The commonly occurring Gto-A polymorphism at nucleotide 723 of <i>CCND1</i> gene has been shown to cause an overall cancer risk among Caucasians and Asians and its interaction with other genetic variants and environmental factors has been shown to be associated with further increase in cancer risk (1.6-7.1-fold increased risk). The c.723G>A polymorphism has also been shown to increase the risk of developing t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation found in multiple myeloma cases. Multiple myeloma is a cancer that develops in the bone marrow, the spongy tissue found in the center of most bones.

Mis-regulation of this process results in aneuploidy (i.e. abnormal number of chromosomes), a distinctive feature of most cancers, which can be induced by overexpression of AURKA in cells. The commonly occurring single-nucleotide polymorphism T91A (Phe31Ile) has been implicated in AURKA overexpression and has been suggested as a low-penetrance susceptibility allele in multiple human cancers. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease that is common in both men and  women. In addition to lifestyle and environmental risk factors, gene defects can contribute to an inherited predisposition to colorectal cancer.

            "DiseaseSummary": " Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide and after lung cancer, the second most frequent cancer in the world. It was shown in several studies that the p.Ile646Val variant of the <i>AKAP10</i> gene is increased the risk of developing breast cancer by 1.58-fold. This risk factor variant alters the binding of AKAP10 to Protein kinase A (PKA), a key regulatory protein and major target of therapeutic anticancer strategies. Phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor (ER) alpha by PKA induces resistance against the antiestrogen tamoxifen. As such, this variant may influence the effectiveness of PKA and tamoxifen based therapies. In another study of Chinese individuals, the p.Ile646Val variant was found to increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer by 1.48-fold in male subjects and 1.81 overall for individuals less than 57 years of age. Among individuals who did not smoke or who smoked lightly, there was also a significantly increased risk of 1.66-fold. \n\nPast and more recent studies have also shown that this variant is associated with increased risk of cardiac conduction defects or arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Sudden cardiac death is unexpected rapid death due to cardiovascular collapse in a short time period, generally within one hour of initial symptoms. It is usually caused by the worsening of existing heart diseases. The sudden onset of symptoms, such as chest pain and cardiac arrhythmias, particularly ventricular tachycardia, can lead to the loss of consciousness and cardiac arrest followed by biological death.",

The <i>ALDH2</i> c. 1510G>A allele was also found to be a risk factor for lung cancer by modifying the impact of smoking on lung cancer (i.e. people with the AA genotype will have a higher risk of cancer especially in smokers vs. non-smokers with odds ratio as high as  23.2, for those who have 45 or more pack years).

",
            "DiseaseSummary": "Factor XI deficiency is a disorder that can cause abnormal bleeding due to a shortage (deficiency) of the factor XI protein, which is involved in blood clotting. This condition is classified as either partial or severe based on the degree of deficiency of the factor XI protein. However, regardless of the severity of the protein deficiency, most affected individuals have relatively mild bleeding problems, and some people with this disorder have few if any symptoms. The most common feature of factor XI deficiency is prolonged bleeding after trauma or surgery, especially involving the inside of the mouth and nose (oral and nasal cavities) or the urinary tract. If the bleeding is left untreated after surgery, solid swellings consisting of congealed blood (hematomas) can develop in the surgical area. Other signs and symptoms of this disorder can include frequent nosebleeds, easy bruising, bleeding under the skin, and bleeding of the gums. Women with this disorder can have heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) or prolonged bleeding after childbirth. In contrast to some other bleeding disorders, spontaneous bleeding into the urine (hematuria), gastrointestinal tract, or skull cavity are not common in factor XI deficiency, although they can occur in severely affected individuals. Bleeding into the muscles or joints, which can cause long-term disability in other bleeding disorders, generally does not occur in this condition.",
            "PopuliationFrequency": "Factor XI deficiency is estimated to affect approximately 1 in 1 million people worldwide. The severe deficiency disorder is much more common in people with central and eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish ancestry, occurring in about 1 in 450 individuals in that population. Researchers suggest that the actual prevalence of factor XI deficiency may be higher than reported, because mild cases of the disorder often do not come to medical attention.",

Over time some of these polyps can become colon cancers. Polyps may be small and produce few, if any, symptoms. For this reason, doctors recommend regular screening tests to help prevent colon cancer by identifying and removing polyps before they turn into cancer. There are several different risk factors that predispose an individual to colon cancer including age, smoking, family history, inflammatory conditions (e.g. Chron’s disease) diet and other lifestyle habits. Another risk factor is inherited genetic variants/mutations in certain genes.
