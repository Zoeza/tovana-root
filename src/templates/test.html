            <h1>DNA UNLOCKED<sup>&reg;</sup> Personalized Nutrition & Fitness Genome Report</h1>
            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p><b>Congratulations! You have now taken an important step to take control of your health.</b></p>
            <p>
                With the <b>DNA UNLOCKED<sup>&reg;</sup> Personalized Nutrition & Fitness Genome Report</b>
                we have analyzed and interpreted vital parts of your genome to give you insights about your
                nutrition and fitness traits. With this knowledge you and your healthcare providers,
                dieticians/nutritionists or fitness trainers could personalize your diet or fitness routine.
            </p>
            <p class="handwriting">Explore your results in good health!</p>
            <h2>HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE</h2>
            <p>
                You have the control of using this guide to learn about whatever aspect of your Nutrition & Fitness genome that you wish. You can read the entire guide or skip to the sections that you are most interested in to gain valuable insights about your Nutrition & Fitness traits. Each section will display the relevant data in an easy to understand format with your result, an interpretation, summary and recommendation when indicated.
            </p>
            <p>
                The conditions or traits in this report are often multigenic or multifactorial, so your predisposition likelihood or relative risk
                (relative to the average risk in the population) will be given to you and you may be classified as (low risk, intermediate risk, or high risk)
                which will be indicated by a "risk meter" as shown below.
            </p>
            <p>
                For certain diseases or traits that are multigenic or multifactorial your predisposition likelihood or relative
                risk percent (relative to the average risk in the population) will be given to you and you may be classified as
                (low risk, intermediate risk, or high risk) which will be indicated by a "risk meter" as shown below.

                In addition, for these multigenic or multifactorial diseases or traits, the scientific strength of each polymorphism or
                variant analyzed is indicated using a 5 star rating system  and
                is factored in to the genetic risk score. The scientific strength is based on 4 factors of evidence that
                contribute to the strength. <b>1.</b> The size of the research study (i.e. how many people enrolled in the study) <b>2.</b>
                the power of the association (power with genome wide significance of 5 x 10<sup>-8</sup> and less) <b>3.</b> the effect size
                (i e size of the odds ratio) <b>4.</b> and whether the results were replicated.
