            <h1>DNA UNLOCKED<sup>&reg;</sup> Personalized Nutrition & Fitness Genome Report</h1>
            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p><b>Congratulations! You have now taken an important step to take control of your health.</b></p>
            <p>
                With the <b>DNA UNLOCKED<sup>&reg;</sup> Personalized Nutrition & Fitness Genome Report</b>
                we have analyzed and interpreted vital parts of your genome to give you insights about your
                nutrition and fitness traits. With this knowledge you and your healthcare providers,
                dieticians/nutritionists or fitness trainers could personalize your diet or fitness routine.
            </p>
            <p class="handwriting">Explore your results in good health!</p>
            <h2>HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE</h2>
            <p>
                You have the control of using this guide to learn about whatever aspect of your Nutrition & Fitness genome that you wish. You can read the entire guide or skip to the sections that you are most interested in to gain valuable insights about your Nutrition & Fitness traits. Each section will display the relevant data in an easy to understand format with your result, an interpretation, summary and recommendation when indicated.
            </p>
            <p>
                The conditions or traits in this report are often multigenic or multifactorial, so your predisposition likelihood or relative risk
                (relative to the average risk in the population) will be given to you and you may be classified as (low risk, intermediate risk, or high risk)
                which will be indicated by a "risk meter" as shown below.
            </p>
            <p>
                For certain diseases or traits that are multigenic or multifactorial your predisposition likelihood or relative
                risk percent (relative to the average risk in the population) will be given to you and you may be classified as
                (low risk, intermediate risk, or high risk) which will be indicated by a "risk meter" as shown below.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, for these multigenic or multifactorial diseases or traits, the scientific strength of each polymorphism or
                variant analyzed is indicated using a 5 star rating system  and
                is factored in to the genetic risk score. The scientific strength is based on 4 factors of evidence that
                contribute to the strength. <b>1.</b> The size of the research study (i.e. how many people enrolled in the study) <b>2.</b>
                the power of the association (power with genome wide significance of 5 x 10<sup>-8</sup> and less) <b>3.</b> the effect size
                (i e size of the odds ratio) <b>4.</b> and whether the results were replicated.

                            <p> Caffeine can have negative effects as well if you consume too much, including upset stomach,
                                heartburn, dehydration, anxiety, shakiness and it can increase your heart rate and blood pressure.
                                Genetic polymorphisms (variants) in certain genes can affect the way the body metabolizes caffeine,

                <b class="heading">Recommendations:</b>
                <p> Caffeine can have many benefits, but also some negative effects if too much is consumed,
                    so consuming the right amount of caffeine is the key to getting the benefits.
                    The general recommendations are to consume a moderate amount of caffeine (up to 400 mg of caffeine per day)
                    which is about 1-2 cups of coffee a day. Prior to exercise/sports activity current guidelines recommend
                    ingestion of 3-9 mg/kg approximately 60 min prior to exercise. Due to the lack of
                    genotype data you should follow the general recommendations for coffee consumption:</p>

                <ul class="recommendations">
                    <li>You may consume between 1-2 cups of coffee per day.</li>
                    <li>Avoid drinking coffee or caffeine at night-time so that it does not affect your sleep.</li>
                    <li>If you ever feel negative effects of caffeine, such as dehydration, shakiness, anxiety,
                        or elevated heart rate/blood pressure, notify your doctor and adjust your caffeine intake.</li>
                </ul>

                <b class="heading">Science:</b>
                <p>
                    Caffeine is primarily metabolized in the liver, almost exclusively by cytochrome P450 enzymes,
                    into araxanthine, theophylline,and theobromine.
                    There is inter-individual variability in the metabolism of caffeine and its effects,
                    based on genetic variations in these enzymes. One of these enzymes, the CYP1A2 (or cytochrome P450 1A2) enzyme,
                    has been extensively studied, and was shown to be responsible for up to 95% of all caffeine metabolism.
                    For individuals that are carriers of the slow metabolizer genotype,
                    research has shown that there is greater risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction (heart attack),
                    so coffee consumption should be limited to no more than 1 cup per day.
                </p>
                <p>,
                    There are multiple haplotypes (i.e. genotype combinations) for the <i>CYP1A2</i> gene,
                    and each haplotype may be more prevalent in one population compared to the others.
                    Multiple studies have shown that individuals of the *1F haplotype, i.e. carriers of the rs762551
                    AA genotype, are rapid metabolizers of caffeine. As a result, these individuals can degrade caffeine and clear caffeine metabolites
                    faster from the blood and would require more caffeine per day to respond and have the same effects of caffeine intake as slow
                    metabolizers. In fact, it was shown that individuals who are fast metabolizers tend to drink more cups of coffee per day.
                    The *1F haplotype is also considered a CYP1A2 enzyme inducer of other drugs (i.e. causes increased metabolism of other
                    drugs/medications a person may be taking and result in reduced biologic activity of the drug).

                </p>
                 <p>
                    <b>Caffeine Metabolizer Status</b>: In general, individuals who are homozygous or heterozygous for the *1F genotype are
                    considered <b>ultra-rapid or rapid metabolizers</b> respectively, those that are homozygous for the *1A genotype are <b>normal metabolizers</b>
                    those that are heterozygous for the ancestral *1A genotype are considered <b>intermediate metabolizers</b>, and those that are homozygous
                    for all other genotypes are considered <b>slow metabolizers</b>.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    In general, Europeans have an increased carrier rate of the rapid metabolizer *1F haplotype, whereas among the
                    Emirati Arab population, it has been shown that most of the population are carriers of the ancestral normal
                    metabolizer *1A haplotype. Arabs in this region are very rarely slow metabolizers of caffeine.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Another intergenic region <b>between the <i>CYP1A1</i> and <i>CYP1A2</i> genes</b> was found to be associated with caffeine consumption.
                    The <b>rs2472297 T allele and rs2470893 T allele</b> were both found to increase caffeine consumption by a nominal amount
                    per day. This effect may be due to greater clearance of caffeine due to higher CYP1A1 or CYP1A2 enzymatic activity.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    Significant evidence of association was also found at the intergenic SNP <b>rs382140</b> near the <b><i>NRCAM</i> gene</b>, a gene which is
                    expressed in the brain and implicated in vulnerability to addiction. The <b>risk A allele</b> was associated with more coffee
                    consumption in the large study of European ancestry individuals.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    The <b><i>AHR</i> gene</b> codes for a transcription factor that helps regulate xenobiotic chemical metabolizing enzyme genes such as the
                    <i>CYP1A1</i> gene. Among the risk alleles that were discovered in the <i>AHR</i> gene is the <b>A allele</b> of the <b>rs6968554 SNP</b> and the
                    <b>T allele</b> of the <b>rs10275488 SNP</b>.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    It should be noted that medications/drugs, epigenetic, and environmental factors, such as smoking (which induces caffeine clearance),
                    can affect CYP1A2 enzymatic activity as well. In addition, polymorphisms in the <i>CYP1A2</i> and other genes not detected in this assay
                    may also affect an individual's caffeine metabolism.

                    plays an important role in insulin synthesis, processing, and secretion. Variations or polymorphisms in this gene have
                    The <b><i>TCF7L2</i> gene</b> is considered the strongest type 2 diabetes (T2D) locus identified in the genome, and evidence suggests it
                    been shown to impaired insulin synthesis, processing, and secretion and thus raise type 2 diabetes risk. Studies have
                    shown that a high-quality carbohydrate diet like that found in whole grains & fibers can modify the risks of these genetic
                    variants. One such variant, the <b>rs12255372 T allele</b> was shown to be associated with greater risk of type 2 diabetes
                    especially when an individual has high glycemic load and glycemic index (i.e. high insulin demand) due to poor diet.
                    Lowering the insulin demand by eating whole grain carbohydrates helps to decrease the effects of this risk allele
                    (genetic marker) and genotype. In another study, whole grain diet was suggestive in having greater effects of lowering
                    HbA1c (measure of glucose over 3 months), total cholesterol and other anthropomorphic measures in individuals with the
                    <b>GT</b> or <b>TT</b> genotype compared to individuals that are not on a whole grain diet. The benefit of whole grain and fiber diet
                    was also observed with the <b>GG genotype</b>, with even greater effects at modifying diabetes measures. Other genetic and
                    environmental factors can also have an important impact on risk of type 2 diabetes and should be considered.

                    <tr>
                        <td style="vertical-align: top">

                            <p>Omega-3 and omega-6 fats are both \"polyunsaturated fats\" (or PUFAs), which have been shown to have
                                beneficial effects on heart health, as well as, allergies, mental health, cognitive development
                                and mortality. Our bodies need both fats but do not make either of them, so we must get them from food.
                                It is good to maintain a 1:1 ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats so be mindful of what you
                                eat, especially if you follow a western diet which has high levels of omega-6. Omega-6 has pro-inflammatory
                                effects and too much omega-6 fats can be bad for you. Some of the effects of too much omega-6 include
                                increase in blood pressure, blood clots that can cause heart attack and stroke, and can cause your body
                                to retain water.
                            </p>

                            <p>These essential polyunsaturated fats can be found in fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, albacore tuna,
                                trout and sardines, as well as plant foods like flaxseeds, walnuts, chia seeds, plant-based oils
                                (canola, soy, corn, safflower and soybean oil). Eating the right amount of these polyunsaturated fats
                                may have heart healthy benefits including lowering blood pressure, controlling blood sugar and slowing
                                the buildup of plaque in arteries. Consuming too much of these foods can lead to weight gain because
                                they are high in calories, so portion control is important. Polymorphisms (variants) of genes encoding
                                enzymes in the metabolism of PUFAs contribute to plasma concentrations of fatty acids and may affect an individual's dietary
                                requirements of these fats.

                    plays an important role in insulin synthesis, processing, and secretion. Variations or polymorphisms in this gene have
                    The <b><i>TCF7L2</i> gene</b> is considered the strongest type 2 diabetes (T2D) locus identified in the genome, and evidence suggests it
                    been shown to impaired insulin synthesis, processing, and secretion and thus raise type 2 diabetes risk. Studies have
                    shown that a high-quality carbohydrate diet like that found in whole grains & fibers can modify the risks of these genetic
                    variants. One such variant, the <b>rs12255372 T allele</b> was shown to be associated with greater risk of type 2 diabetes
                    especially when an individual has high glycemic load and glycemic index (i.e. high insulin demand) due to poor diet.
                    Lowering the insulin demand by eating whole grain carbohydrates helps to decrease the effects of this risk allele
                    (genetic marker) and genotype. In another study, whole grain diet was suggestive in having greater effects of lowering
                    HbA1c (measure of glucose over 3 months), total cholesterol and other anthropomorphic measures in individuals with the
                    <b>GT</b> or <b>TT</b> genotype compared to individuals that are not on a whole grain diet. The benefit of whole grain and fiber diet
                    was also observed with the <b>GG genotype</b>, with even greater effects at modifying diabetes measures. Other genetic and
                    environmental factors can also have an important impact on risk of type 2 diabetes and should be considered.
